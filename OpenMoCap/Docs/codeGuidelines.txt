1. Instance variables should be prefixed with '_'
2. Getters and setters must be defined and implement in the header (.h) file if no complex logic is needed.
3. Shared variables must be named with the suffix "Ref", but without it where they are initialized. (Look Mocap and MainWindow classes)
4. All comments must be written in ENGLISH.
5. Doxygen comments must only be written in declaration files (.h extension).
6. Doxygen comments for getters and setters methods are optional if no complex logic is required.

Building Problems

There might be some problems on installing OpenMoCap on your station. Most of it, 
is due of not setted system / build variables or system / build variables with 
wrong values. Let’s see some of what could happen on your installation.

  - Can’t build the project because it don’t find any “moc” files.

	When you checkout the trunk on repository then you have to Clean the project 
	and then Build it. But even when you correctly installed the QT Library it 
	don’t find the correct Qt Moc Compiler, then set it manually! You’ll have to 
	modify the Makefile file on the directory \src\Gui in the line that refers 
	it:

		- QT_MOC_COMPILER = moc
		+ QT_MOC_COMPILER = C:\Qt\2009.03\qt\bin\moc.exe

	In my case!
	Then you’ll be able to Build and Clean the project as you wish.

  - On the last steps of the Building process, some of the OptiTrack libs are 
  	not finded.

	It happens because the main installation of the Natural Point Optitrack 
	Drivers are installed in a different directory than the main build variables 
	are setted. Just set the new right value for directory on the variable 
	OPTITRACK_HOME on (Eclipse) Project / Properties / C/C++ Build / Build 
	Variables.

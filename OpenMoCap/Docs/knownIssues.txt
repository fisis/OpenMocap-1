OpenMocap Known Issues
Last Revision: 18/02/2009
#########################

1. Google's webcamera plugin for gtalk.
It creates two virtual camera adapters that are not well handled by videoInput and OpenMocap.
The program will crash.

2. videoInput x OptiTrack SDK
coInitializeEx's calls use different models. Initialize it first with apartment thread model.

3. MATLAB
Put Qt's bin directory before Matlab's bin directory in system or user PATH. Matlab may use an
older version of Qt libraries, preventing OpenMoCap from running (DLL errors).
